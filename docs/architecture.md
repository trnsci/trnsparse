# Architecture

## Why BSR is Trainium-native

Trainium's Tensor Engine is a 128×128 systolic array. `nisa.nc_matmul`
moves a 128-partition stationary tile against a moving operand of up to
128 × 512, all on-chip. The natural "unit of sparse work" on this
architecture is therefore not a single nonzero — it's a 128×128 block.

**BSR (block-sparse row)** at `block_size=128` stores a matrix as a list
of these blocks plus a block-level CSR pattern. Every stored block is
already in the shape the systolic array wants: one `nc_matmul` per block,
no gather step, no padding-within-tile waste. The architectural match is
exact.

Contrast with CSR, which stores individual nonzero elements. The v0.2.0
NKI path for CSR materializes the matrix into a dense `(M, K)` tile
before the matmul (see the [SpMM path](#v020-csr-spmm-path) below) —
necessary for correctness, but it pays the full `M × K` cost whether the
matrix is sparse or not. BSR skips this because blocks are already dense.

**Consequence for the library's shape:** CSR remains the construction and
interop format (scipy compatibility, PyTorch's `torch.sparse_csr_tensor`
interop). BSR is the compute format for the NKI path. For matrices with
real block structure — Fock/ERI tensors after Schwarz screening, FEM
stiffness matrices, graph adjacencies, block-sparse attention masks —
BSR is strictly preferred. For truly unstructured sparse (random CSR),
the PyTorch fallback is already within 2× of scipy; NKI adds nothing.

See [Benchmarks](benchmarks.md) for numbers that validate this framing.

## NKI SpMM strategy

SpMM on Trainium uses a gather-matmul-scatter pattern:

1. **DMA engine**: gather non-zero column indices into dense SBUF tiles
2. **Tensor Engine**: matmul the dense tile against B columns
3. **DMA engine**: scatter results back to output rows

This is the same pattern used in sparse attention. The efficiency depends on the nnz distribution per row — uniform nnz maps cleanly to fixed-size tiles; highly variable nnz needs row-bucketing.

## Formats

- **CSR** (compressed sparse row): preferred for SpMV with many right-hand sides and for SpMM. Row pointer + column indices + values.
- **COO** (coordinate): preferred for construction and permutation. Three parallel 1-D tensors.

Conversions `csr_to_coo()` / `coo_to_csr()` are cheap (bucket sort).

## Dispatch

`nki/dispatch.py` exposes `HAS_NKI`, `set_backend("auto"|"pytorch"|"nki")`, `get_backend()`, and the NKI entry points. In v0.2.0, `spmm` routes through `_use_nki()` and calls `_spmm_dense_kernel` on the Tensor Engine. `spmv`, `spmv_symmetric`, and screening still run the PyTorch path (single-column NKI matmul doesn't pay off).

### v0.2.0 CSR SpMM path

Forward — `_SpMMFunction.forward`:

1. Materialize the CSR into a dense `(M, K)` tile (host-side).
2. Pad `M`, `K` up to 128-multiples and `N` up to a 512-multiple (only when `N > 512`).
3. Move padded A and B to the XLA device; dispatch `_spmm_dense_kernel`.
4. Slice the result back to the caller's `(M, N)`.

The kernel is the trnblas GEMM pattern: stationary A-tile on the systolic array, streaming B tiles via `nisa.nc_matmul`, PSUM accumulation across K-tiles, one store per output tile.

Backward — `_SpMMFunction.backward`, PyTorch-level:

- `dL/dA_dense = dL/dC @ Bᵀ` (projects back through the `to_dense()` graph onto the original CSR values)
- `dL/dB = A_denseᵀ @ dL/dC`

This wrapping satisfies [`trnsci/trnsci#3`](https://github.com/trnsci/trnsci/issues/3) — the suite-wide requirement that every NKI kernel live inside a `torch.autograd.Function` so training-time `loss.backward()` works. `torch.autograd.gradcheck` on small inputs is part of the hardware test matrix.

### Known limits (v0.2.0)

- **No sparsity exploitation.** Materialize-then-GEMM pays the full `M × K` cost. Row-bucketing is the v0.3.0 ([#15](https://github.com/trnsci/trnsparse/issues/15)) Phase 3 story. See [Benchmarks](benchmarks.md) for where NKI sits today vs scipy / torch.sparse.
- **SpMV stays PyTorch.** A single output column on the Tensor Engine doesn't justify the compile + dispatch overhead.
